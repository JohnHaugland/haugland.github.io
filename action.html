    <h1> 10. BAD BOYS (1995)</h1>
    <img src="images/shed.jpg">
    <p>Michael Bay's first action movie is free of the bloated excess and undisciplined pacing from most of his later output -- we're looking at you, Every. Single. Transformers. Movie. The goal here is to mainline to the audience straight-up action movie thrills and two charismatic AF performances from Will Smith and Martin Lawrence.<br>The stars play two Miami police officers involved in a case that requires slick cars, lots of slow-motion shots, and explosions to solve. While Independence Day is often credited with making Will Smith, well, Will Smith, Bad Boys put him on the launch pad for leading man status.</p><br><br>
